<p>This webpage is used as an online portfolio of mine and a practice environment for me to develop the skills needed to work in a web application. I intend to populate this web page with beginner and intermediate materials to start developing in one of the programming languages I am confident with, and an area where my projects and web applications can be found, downloaded or run.</p>

<p>Please see the respective header for more information.</p>

<p>Another use-case of this page is to practice and develop my written English as this page will be available in English only, although I am of different origin.</p>
