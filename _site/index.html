<h3 id="-website-is-still-wip-">!!! Website is still WIP !!!</h3>

<p>This webpage is intended as an online portfolio of mine and a practice environment for me to develop the skills needed to work 
with web applications. I want to populate this web page with materials to start developing in programming 
languages I am confident with and an area where my projects and web applications can be found, downloaded or run.</p>

<hr />

<p>Under <a href="/resources">Resources</a> you can find a couple of posts that explain how to get started in the world of programming. I will talk about each topic
in detail with plenty of examples. The following categories are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>None yet</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Under <a href="/exercises">Exercises</a> you can find a couple of exercises which can be used to practice certain topics. Each exercise is accompanied by example solutions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Under <a href="/projects">Projects</a> you will find software that I wrote for either desktop, mobile or web. Downloads will be highlighted as such, otherwise
you’ll be redirected to a web application. Here’s an overview of all my applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>None yet</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>In addition to programming I wanted to practice my written English as this page will be available in English only. I thought about creating a web page
that supports my endeavor of developing a better way of writing about topics that interest me and then this project came to be. If you have specific questions
in either English or German I’ll be happy to help. See the <a href="/about">About</a> page for more information.</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope you found what you came here for and I wish you all the best.</p>
