# Welcome to my website

This webpage was intended as an online portfolio of mine and a practice environment for me to develop the skills needed to work 
with web applications. I intend to populate this web page with materials to start developing in programming 
languages I am confident with, and an area where my projects and web applications can be found, downloaded or run.

In addition to programming I wanted to practice my written English as this page will be available in English only. I thought about creating a web page
that supports my endeavor of developing a better way of writing about topics that interest me and then this project came to be. If you have specific questions
in either English or German I'll be happy to help. See the [About]({{ site.data.navigation[2].link }}) page for more information.

I hope you found what you came here for and I wish you all the best.
